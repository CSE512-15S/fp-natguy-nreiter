{"name":"Telemetry Visualization","tagline":"","body":"# Summary\r\n\r\nThis is a networked JavaScript application (and accompanying Arduino application for real data, and Python data simulator for synthesized data) that allows the visualization, within a 2D/3D interface, of data sent from another device.\r\n\r\n# Development Notes\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nThe server is [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), which can be installed minimally using:\r\n\r\n    pip install flask\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\nTo run the visualization server/client combo, in the root directory either run:\r\n\r\n    flask -a viz --debug run # Requires Flask 1.0, I believe (?)\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n    python viz.py # Using python -m viz might be preferable, if we can get that working with flask\r\n\r\nThis will start a [localhost server](http://localhost:5000) on port 5000.\r\n\r\nThe first command requires Flask 1.0, I believe, but handles restarting the server for new code in a more reliable way.\r\n\r\nUsing python -m viz might be preferable to the second case, but might require some finagling to get working.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
