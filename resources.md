This document contains some helpful resources for learning the theory behind FDIR and getting ideas about how it's approached in the aerospace industry.

# Ideas and Cool Examples

- [Cheesy NASA video about cool telemetry analysis tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=11&v=22hfUd7NCSE). We obviously don't have to be anywhere near as feature-complete as this tool, but the video gives you a good idea of what most telemetry monitoring software looks like. We could definitely come up with some better visualizations for live data as well as for reviewing past data.

The screenshots show a relatively normal, information-light layout, but the design is very clean and looks so much more modern than any of the telemetry programs actually in use...
